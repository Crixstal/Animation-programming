## **Description**

The project objective is to understand the basics of animation through the Unreal base model.

<br>

## **Informations**

The engine used can cause data races, therefore the mesh sometimes doesn't appear. Just restart the application until the mesh is displayed.

<br>

## **Work**

Done
---
- skeleton / mesh draw in T-Pose
- mesh draw when running / walking
- slerp between animation's frames to smooth

<br>

In progress
---
- skeleton draw when running / walking
- transition between walking / running animations (crossfade AKA blending)

<br>
